Project 2 - Full-Stack Web Application
This application was assigned by UC Berkeley Bootcamp and solves real-world problems by integrating data received from using the MVC paradigm and server-side API. The website was built collaboratively by scratch using visual studio code and deployed from Github pages. The website is designed to let a user sign up and sign in to search and view favorite villagers from the online game Animal Crossing. Once the user searches a character or villager, their villager will appear on the main page displaying their name, photo, species, personality, hobby, birthday, catchphrase, favorite song, and favorite saying using Animal Crossing API. 
 
 This application is user friendly and consists of a top navbar for direction and a footer for connection. Multiple coding pages are used such as index.html, style.css, app.js and a .gitignore page. Materialize is the CSS framework used to style the web page, Animal Crossing API is for the search application, and NPM for Node JavaScript platform. The hope of this web application is to provide a fun and interactive search engine tool that is simple to navigate.
This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To test it out yourself, you can follow this deployment link: https://github.com/Shellsea31/Project_2/
